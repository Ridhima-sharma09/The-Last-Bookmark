## Made with Love, Memory , Gratitude and Blessing 
This project is dedicated to my teacher — the one who made me fall in love with learning.  
She gifted me **bookmarks and books**, and unknowingly, the **courage to dream.**  
it has been one year since **Ms.Shivani Sharma** left us —  her battle with cancer ended, but her lessons stayed — this project stands as a **tribute from my side.**  

I often find myself reminiscing about those **9th-grade days** when she handed me bookmarks that I still keep safely.  
I was so excited to share my **10th-grade result** with her — and though she’s no longer here, her presence still guides me in every achievement.  
This app is my way of keeping her **memory alive — in code, love, and gratitude.**
